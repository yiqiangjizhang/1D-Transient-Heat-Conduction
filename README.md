# 1D-Transient-Heat-Conduction
One-dimensional Transient Heat Conduction in a semi-infinite Domain

## Problem statement
We are interested in the temporal evolution of the ground temperature distribution. A onedimensional time-dependant heat conduction equation will be assumed to be valid to model the ground temperature (therefore, neglecting humidity changes or other aspects that may be actually relevant).
